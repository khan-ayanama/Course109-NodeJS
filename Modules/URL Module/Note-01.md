# URL Module

The Node.js url module is a built-in module that provides methods for working with URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). It's particularly useful for parsing and manipulating URLs in web applications. Here are some common tasks you can perform using the url module:

`Parsing URLs:` You can use the url.parse() method to parse a URL string into its various components like protocol, hostname, port, path, query, and more.

* `Here's an example:`

```js
    const url = require('url');

    const myUrl = 'https://www.example.com:8080/some/path?param1=value1&param2=value2';

    const parsedUrl = url.parse(myUrl, true);
    // true: When true is passed as the second argument, it tells the url.parse() method to parse the query string (the part of the URL after the ?) into an object. This makes it easier to work with query parameters.

    console.log(parsedUrl);
```

This will give you an object containing all the components of the URL.

* `Constructing URLs:` You can use the url.format() method to construct a URL from its components. Here's an example:

```js
    const url = require('url');

    const myUrl = url.format({
    protocol: 'https',
    hostname: 'www.example.com',
    port: 8080,
    pathname: '/some/path',
    query: { param1: 'value1', param2: 'value2' },
    });

    console.log(myUrl);
```

This will output the complete URL string.

* `Resolving URLs:` The url.resolve() method allows you to resolve a relative URL against a base URL. This is useful when you want to create absolute URLs from relative ones. Here's an example:

```js
    const url = require('url');

    const baseUrl = 'https://www.example.com/some/';
    const relativeUrl = '../another/page';

    const resolvedUrl = url.resolve(baseUrl, relativeUrl);

    console.log(resolvedUrl);
```

This will give you the absolute URL: `https://www.example.com/another/page`.

The url module in Node.js makes working with URLs in your applications more convenient. It's especially useful when dealing with web servers, APIs, or any task that involves handling URLs. If you have any specific questions or need more details, feel free to ask, Boss!
