# OS Module

The Node.js os module provides a set of operating system-related utility methods and properties. You can use this module to access information about the underlying operating system on which your Node.js application is running. Here are some of the commonly used functions and properties provided by the os module:

`os.arch():` Returns a string representing the CPU architecture of the operating system, such as "x64" or "arm."

`os.cpus():` Returns an array of objects containing information about each CPU/core, including model, speed, and times for idle, user, and system.

`os.freemem():` Returns the amount of free system memory in bytes.

`os.totalmem():` Returns the total amount of system memory in bytes.

`os.hostname():` Returns the hostname of the operating system.

`os.platform():` Returns the platform of the operating system, such as "win32," "linux," or "darwin" (macOS).

`os.release():` Returns the release version of the operating system.

`os.type():` Returns the operating system name as a string, such as "Linux" or "Windows_NT."

`os.uptime():` Returns the system uptime in seconds.

`os.userInfo([options]):` Returns information about the current user as an object, including username, UID, and home directory. This function is not available on all platforms.

Here's an example of how you can use the os module to retrieve some basic system information:

```js
    const os = require('os');

    console.log('CPU Architecture:', os.arch());
    console.log('CPU Cores:', os.cpus().length);
    console.log('Free Memory (bytes):', os.freemem());
    console.log('Total Memory (bytes):', os.totalmem());
    console.log('Hostname:', os.hostname());
    console.log('Platform:', os.platform());
    console.log('Release:', os.release());
    console.log('System Type:', os.type());
    console.log('Uptime (seconds):', os.uptime());
```

`os.networkInterfaces():` Returns an object that provides information about the network interfaces on the machine, including IP addresses, MAC addresses, and more.

`os.tmpdir():` Returns the directory for temporary files on the system.

`os.homedir():` Returns the home directory of the current user.

`os.endianness():` Returns the endianness of the CPU. It will be either "LE" (Little Endian) or "BE" (Big Endian).

`os.loadavg():` Returns an array containing the 1-minute, 5-minute, and 15-minute load averages of the system.

`os.constants:` An object containing various constant values related to error codes, signals, and priority levels. For example, os.constants.signals provides a list of signal names and their corresponding numbers.

The os module provides valuable information about the system, which can be useful for tasks like system monitoring, resource management, and platform-specific code adaptation. Depending on your use case, you can leverage these functions and properties to gather and work with system-related data in your Node.js applications.
